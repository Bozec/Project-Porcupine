Project Porcupine
http://towerdive.com/forum/community-project/

This is a Unity 3D 3.5 project.

== How to Contribute

1. Make sure you are running Unity 3D 3.5.

This is currently in beta pre-release and is available here:
		http://unity3d.com/unity/preview/

2. Use Git to clone the repository.

How to use Git is beyond the scope of this document.

Getting start with Git:

How to install Git on Windows:

The command to clone our repository:
  git clone git@github.com:TeamPorcupine/Project-Porcupine.git

3. Go into the Assets/Scenes folder of the project and double-click "_dummy-scene.scene".

This will launch Unity and cause it to create its /Library folder, which is not a part of the repository.


== Unity and Version Control

Unity 3.5 will no longer explode when you attempt to use version control, but all non-script files are
still binary files, which means that if two people make a change to a file (including models, textures,
prefabs, and sounds) at the same time, person's changes will ultimately overwrite the other's.

This is to be expected, of course.  If two people change a 3D model, there's really no logical way to
merge the changes.  Luckily, simultaneous modification of binary files should be relatively rare. The
exception to this may be changes to the scene file, since hitting CTRL-S saves all your prefab changes
AND ALSO saves the scene.  Since scene "_dummy-scene" contains nothing, it will always be safe to override
each other's changes.

Of course, script source code is text and should merge cleanly.
