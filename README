Project Porcupine
http://towerdive.com/forum/community-project/

This is a Unity 3D project.  Please note that prefabs and other binary files are not versionable and
files are likely to override one another rather than merge.  This may cause conflicts, which may
require manual resolution.

We will explore different .gitignore configurations as we move forward, and we may simply avoid
using any prefab configuration whatsoever, in favor of pure programmatic instantiation of all
objects save for a dummy GameObject with a single script that launches everything.

Alternatively, we may want to simply have the master unity project be a download, and only
commit the /Assets folder (and /Libary/*.assets) files.
